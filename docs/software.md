# Workflow software

The overall workflow is divided into a number of separate Shortcuts. Some of the Shortcuts – the primary actions in the scanning workflow – are meant to be invoked directly by the user; other Shortcuts act as helper modules used by the primary Shortcuts.

## Installation and configuration

## Main workflow Shortcuts

The separation into separate software components offers the advantage that users can take as much time as they need in-between steps.


## Shortcut triggers

We used an external wireless device to trigger the main workflow Shortcuts. This makes it possible for a user to operate the workflow with the device placed near them, instead of having to reach over and interact with the phone directly.
