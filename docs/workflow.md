# The Soca workflow

One of the essential tasks for staff at the Caltech Library Archives is to select and scan paper materials that are in bankers boxes, and put them into archival boxes. A typical collection can consist of tens of thousands of pages of documents. The huge number of pages to be handled means that we need an efficient, simple, and fast workflow. Soca (_Smartphone-Oriented Collection Processing_) is an experiment in creating such a workflow using commodity devices and software services.

## Example scanning setup

The Caltech Archives recently accessioned materials from [Robert H. Grubbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Grubbs). Grubbs was a Caltech faculty member and Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry. The hybrid collection consists of over 100 carton-size boxes of papers and thousands of digital files and emails.

Caltech Archives personnel evaluate the materials to determine which ones should be kept and digitized (we cannot keep all of the materials). The materials that are kept for transferred into archival boxes such as the ones shown below.

Our experiment in simple, rapid scanning used a height-adjustable table (for the comfort of staff doing the work) and a large ring light positioned above the table. The ring light has a phone mount in the middle where we place an Apple iPhone with the camera facing the table surface.

## Steps in the scanning workflow

The scanning workflow has a modular design. The overall workflow is divided into a few separate actions:

1. Start a new destination box (one of the gray archival boxes)
2. Start a new destination folder (a manilla folder placed inside a gray archival box)
3. Take photos of document pages as needed
4. Go to step 1

Steps 1â€“3 are implemented as [_Shortcuts_](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) on the Apple iPhone mounted in the center of the ring light.
