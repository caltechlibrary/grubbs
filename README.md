Shortcuts can be exported and saved as files. These shortcuts can be imported into the Shortcuts app on MacOS using the menu item _File_ ▹ _Import_.

Installing the shortcuts directly on an iPhone is more difficult because there is no equivalent import command in the iOS version of Shortcuts. Instead, it is easier to use the iCloud sharing mechanism provided by Apple for the purpose of distributing Shortcuts.
